# GumBumBot

# Summary
This is a recreation of the boardgame Risk I made in Java in a team of 3 as part of my second year of computer science
in UCD. The folder 'Sprint4' contains the source code for the version of risk designed by us.
The folder 'res' contains a few images we used for our GUI which was implemented in Java Swing.
The folder 'BOT' contains a bot we designed to play Risk using a version of Risk implemented by our professor
so all students were working with the same version

# Testing
Our unit tests mostly cover our validation methods
We tested that they worked using unit tests and then tested that the full package worked together using player testing
